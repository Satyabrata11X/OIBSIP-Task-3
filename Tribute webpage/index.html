            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk and one of the most influential spiritual leaders of India. Born in
                1863, he played a major role in the revival of Hinduism in India and introduced Indian philosophies of
                Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. He is best known for his powerful speech at the Parliament of the
                World's Religions in Chicago in 1893, where he began with the iconic words, "Sisters and Brothers of
                America." A disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, Vivekananda believed in service to humanity as service to God
                and founded the Ramakrishna Mission to promote education, healthcare, and spiritual growth. His
                teachings continue to inspire people to lead lives of strength, compassion, and purpose.</p>
